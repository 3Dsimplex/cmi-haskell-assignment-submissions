# CMI-Haskell-Assignment-codes

A repository to store the programs by students for Haskell Assignments  
So that we can learn from each other's solutions.

The structure for the repo will be like -
- assign1
  - questions1.pdf
  - user1.1.hs
  - user2.1.hs
- assign2
  - questions2.pdf
  - user1.2.hs
  - user2.2.hs   
 
Name your solution file `username.<assignment-num>.hs`, add to the corresponding
folder.  

Push project files atleast 3 days after the submission date.  
A folder with the name of the assignment will be created 3 days after the submission date, add your files to that folder.  

### Uploading files using The website GUI:

- Step 1:   
  Click on the fork button in the top right corner of the web page 
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/Fork_button.png)

  Eneter the directory of the assignment you want to submit
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/folder.png)

  Click on add file, then upload file, upload your haskell assignment 
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/Uploading.png)
  Then write a small commit message like `Added user.assignment_number.hs` and commit the change  
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/Saving_Commit.png)

  Go back to the mail page of the fork and click on Contribute then `Open Pull Request` 
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/PR1.png)  
  You should be on a page where you can view the changes you have made, after making sure than you have added the correct file in the correct directory, click on   `Create Pull Request`
  ![yo](/images%20for%20README/PR2.png)
  Write a short sensible message \[50 chars\] and below it a short description and click on  `Create Pull Request`

Your files would later be merged into the main branch by me, then you will be able to see your files in the repository
