# CMI-Haskell-Assignment-codes

A repository to store the programs by students for Haskell Assignments  
So that we can learn from each other's solutions.

The structure for the repo will be like -
- assign1
  - questions1.pdf
  - user1.1.hs
  - user2.1.hs
- assign2
  - questions2.pdf
  - user1.2.hs
  - user2.2.hs   
 
Name your solution file `username.<assignment-num>.hs`, add to the corresponding
folder.  

Push project files atleast 3 days after the submission date.
